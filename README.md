## Template data

```
 {
   status_port : this.status_port,
   stream : {
     'app1' : {
       port : 7000,
       balance : 'roundrobin',
       instances : [{
         port : 9010
       }, {
         port : 9011
       }, {

   },
   http : {
     'app2' : {
       port : 7000,
       balance : 'roundrobin',
       instances : [{
         port : 9010
       }, {
         port : 9011

     }
   }
 };
```

## Reality

- http/https application = layer 4 load balancing (fast) = round_robin, least_conn
- ws/http/https application = layer 7 load balancing (slow) = ip_hash
- node portfinder: https://github.com/indexzero/node-portfinder

- Graceful reload:

Express: res.set("Connection", "close");

## Parameters

The max_fails directive sets the number of consecutive unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the server that should happen during fail_timeout. By default, max_fails is set to 1. When it is set to 0, health checks are disabled for this server. The fail_timeout parameter also defines how long the server will be marked as failed. After fail_timeout interval following the server failure, nginx will start to gracefully probe the server with the live clientâ€™s requests. If the probes have been successful, the server is marked as a live one.

Further reading

In addition, there are more directives and parameters that control server load balancing in nginx, e.g. proxy_next_upstream, backup, down, and keepalive. For more information please check our reference documentation.
